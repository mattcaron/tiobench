1999-12-01	Mika Kuoppala <miku at iki.fi>

	* 0.07:	Long option parsing. Typo fixes by James.

	* 0.08:	Long option parsing now behind define. 
	Some systems are missing getopt_long :( This has to 
	solved out more general way in future.

	* 0.09: pthread_init_attr, pthread_destroy_attr 
	were missing. Sami noticed this with Irix

	* 0.10: Makefile cleanup. _GNU_SOURCE and _REENTRANT added 
	to tiotest.c for correct behaviour of system header files.

	* 0.11: tiobench.pl by James added to distribution. Changes to
	output formatting in tiotest.c.

1999-12-02       Mika Kuoppala <miku at iki.fi>

	* 0.12:	Sequential writing is now an option.
	This prevents write phase fragmentation of test files. 
	Suggested by Jakob

1999-12-04       Mika Kuoppala <miku at iki.fi>

	* 0.13:	Tiobench.pl has now seeks as an option, 
	It also finds tiotest better. Few other minor fixes and 
	typos corrected.

1999-12-05       James Manning <jmm at users.sf.net>

	* 0.14: Minor tiobench.pl cleanups

1999-12-07       Mika Kuoppala <miku at iki.fi>

2000-01-04       James Manning <jmm at users.sf.net>

	* 0.16: tiobench.pl now figures default filesize by peeking 
	available physical ram.

2000-02-04       Mika Kuoppala <miku at iki.fi>

	* 0.20:	 Makefile is now hopefully more portable.
	Rewrote the random seeks handling totally. It can now handle
	systems with 15bit RAND_MAX correctly.

	Rewrote output for both verbose and terse options.
	Quick hacked tiobench.pl to accept new terse output.
	Minor cleanups and fixes here and there.
	Moved tiobench.sh to funnyscripts directory in order to
	lessen confusion among users.
	Added BUGS file into distribution.

2000-02-04       Mika Kuoppala <miku at iki.fi>

	* 0.21	 Few fixes in output handling.
	James found out that in glibc 2.1.(x<3) rand_r is broken.
	This should be fixed by how tiotest handles rand_r now.

        - remove #define checks for USE_MMAP/USE_MADVISE

2003-11-18       James Manning <jmm at users.sf.net>

	* 0.3.5 - massive refactor to a single do_generic_test

	fixed usrcpu% and syscpu% accordingly
	- fixed mmap
	- consistency checking of data is working again 
	  (it was completely removed at some point, why ?)
	- mmap with sync now only syncs the most recently written piece, 
	  not whole region
	- testfile is not opened with O_TRUNC because that breaks consistency 
	  checking (by reading files full of zeros)
	- fixed minor memory leak on thread data allocation
	- cleanups
